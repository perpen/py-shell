Ideas:
- Use attributes or methods depending on parameters.
- Command ctor should take optional default argv
- Bit crazy: transform any shell script into equivalent Python script.

Vision:
- Make use of Unix or server commands more testable: unit tests.

Why Python?
No nice way of unit-testing shell scripts.
Exceptions allow for clearer code, better error detection.

Cons
- Editor cannot detect whether methods exist, so not as useful as could be.
- Less concise?
- Need to learn new lib?

Use cases
- Start Tomcat
- Backup script
